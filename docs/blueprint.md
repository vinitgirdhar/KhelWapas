## Style Guidelines:

- Primary: Deep Blue (#1E3A8A) — anchors trust, security, and reliability for an eCommerce marketplace, ideal for navigation, headers, and key text.
- Accent/CTAs: Vibrant Orange (#F97316) — energetic, attention-grabbing for “Sell Now,” “Add to Cart,” and promos; a proven pairing with blue for conversion-oriented CTAs.
- Support/Signal: Fresh Green (#10B981) — communicates sustainability, refurbishment, and “Inspected/Refurbished” trust badges, aligning with the preowned model’s eco message.
- Font pairing: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for headlines paired with 'Inter' (sans-serif) for body text. This pairing gives a tech-forward yet readable feel, ideal for a modern marketplace.
- Use clean, minimalist icons representing various sports and equipment types, ensuring easy recognition and visual clarity.
- A grid-based layout with clear product categorization and filters allows for intuitive navigation and streamlined shopping experiences.
