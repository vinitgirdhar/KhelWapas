# 🔄 Dev Server Restart Instructions

## Issue
After applying the performance optimizations, the dev server needs to be restarted with a clean cache to load all the updated components properly.

## ✅ What I've Done
1. Cleaned the `.next` build directory
2. Cleaned the `node_modules/.cache` directory
3. Started the dev server with `npm run dev`

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Wait for Server to Fully Start
The dev server is currently starting. It may take 30-60 seconds to:
- Compile all the optimized components
- Build the new chunks
- Start listening on port 9002

**Check if it's ready:**
- Open http://localhost:9002 in your browser
- You should see the homepage load
- Check the terminal for "Ready" message

### Option 2: Manual Restart (If Needed)

If the server doesn't start properly, manually restart it:

```bash
# Stop any running processes
# Press Ctrl+C in the terminal running npm run dev

# Clean the cache
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force .next
Remove-Item -Recurse -Force node_modules/.cache

# Start fresh
npm run dev
```

## 🧪 Testing After Restart

Once the server is running, test these optimizations:

### 1. Main Site
- Click on product cards - should feel instant
- Click navigation links - should respond in <100ms
- Open mobile menu - should open smoothly
- Test add to cart buttons

### 2. Admin Panel
- Navigate to http://localhost:9002/admin/login
- Login with: admin@khelwapas.com / admin123
- Click dashboard stat cards - instant navigation
- Open dropdown menus - should open in ~100ms
- Click "Add Product" button - instant response

### 3. Performance Check
- Open DevTools → Performance tab
- Record a button click
- Check that interaction time is <100ms
- Verify smooth 60fps animations

## 📊 Expected Results

You should notice:
- ✅ Buttons respond instantly to clicks
- ✅ Dropdown menus open in ~100ms
- ✅ Navigation feels snappy
- ✅ No lag on mobile
- ✅ Smooth animations throughout

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### If you see errors:
1. Check the terminal for specific error messages
2. Verify all files were saved properly
3. Try clearing browser cache (Ctrl+Shift+R)
4. Check that port 9002 is not in use

### If performance isn't improved:
1. Hard refresh the browser (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. Clear browser cache completely
3. Check DevTools Console for errors
4. Verify the optimized components are loading
