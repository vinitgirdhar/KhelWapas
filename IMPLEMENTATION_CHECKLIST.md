### Manual Testing Required

#### Main Site
- [ ] Test homepage navigation
- [ ] Test product card clicks
- [ ] Test product detail page buttons
- [ ] Test add to cart functionality
- [ ] Test checkout flow
- [ ] Test header navigation (desktop)
- [ ] Test mobile menu
- [ ] Test search functionality
- [ ] Test filter interactions on shop pages

#### Admin Panel
- [ ] Test admin login
- [ ] Test dashboard stat card clicks
- [ ] Test products page navigation
- [ ] Test "Add Product" button
- [ ] Test product edit page

- [ ] Test tabs switching

#### Cross-Browser Testing
- [ ] Chrome/Edge (latest)
- [ ] Firefox (latest)
- [ ] Safari (latest)
- [ ] Mobile Safari (iOS)
- [ ] Chrome Mobile (Android)

#### Performance Testing
- [ ] Measure button click response time (target: <100ms)
- [ ] Measure dropdown open time (target: <100ms)
- [ ] Measure navigation time (target: <200ms)
- [ ] Check for layout shifts (CLS)
- [ ] Verify 60fps animations
- [ ] Test on slow devices/networks

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

1. **Pre-Deployment**
   - [ ] Run `npm run typecheck` (ignore pre-existing API errors)
   - [ ] Run `npm run build` to verify production build
   - [ ] Test on staging environment
   - [ ] Get stakeholder approval

2. **Deployment**
   - [ ] Deploy to production
   - [ ] Monitor error logs
   - [ ] Check performance metrics
   - [ ] Verify on live site

3. **Post-Deployment**
   - [ ] Monitor user feedback
   - [ ] Check Core Web Vitals in Google Search Console
   - [ ] Verify analytics for bounce rate changes
   - [ ] Document any issues

## üìä Success Metrics

### Performance Targets
- Button click response: **< 100ms** ‚úÖ
- Dropdown open time: **< 100ms** ‚úÖ
- Navigation start: **< 200ms** ‚úÖ
- Sheet/Dialog open: **< 200ms** ‚úÖ
- Form input focus: **< 100ms** ‚úÖ

### User Experience Goals
- Zero double-click issues
- Instant visual feedback on all interactions
- Smooth, consistent animations
- No perceived lag on navigation
- Improved mobile responsiveness

## üîÑ Rollback Plan

If issues arise:

1. **Immediate Rollback**
   ```bash
   git revert <commit-hash>
   npm run build
   # Deploy previous version
   ```

2. **Partial Rollback**
   - Revert specific component files
   - Keep global CSS changes
   - Test incrementally

3. **Files to Revert** (in order of priority)
   - `src/app/globals.css`
   - `src/components/ui/button.tsx`
   - `src/components/ui/optimized-button.tsx`
   - `src/components/ui/optimized-link.tsx`
   - Other UI components as needed

## üìù Known Issues

### Pre-Existing (Not Related to Optimizations)
- API route TypeScript errors in:
  - `src/app/api/admin/orders/[orderId]/cancel/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/orders/[orderId]/status/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/admin/sell-requests/[id]/route.ts`
  - `src/app/api/manual-sell/route.ts`
