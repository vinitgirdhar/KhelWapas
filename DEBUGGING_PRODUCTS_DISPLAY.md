# Products Not Displaying - Debug Steps

## ‚úÖ Backend Status - WORKING

### API Endpoint Status:
- **`GET /api/products?available=true`** ‚úÖ Returns 200 OK
- **Products returned:** 6 products
- **Images:** All products have valid image URLs
- **Sample response:**
  ```json
  {
    "success": true,
    "products": [
      {
        "id": "99bf3e09-5db5-43a2-96d2-60ff41b988ca",
        "name": "Cosco Sprint 66 Nylon Shuttlecock",
        "image": "/uploads/products/1758706675360-xnsz54k5czm.jpg",
        "images": ["/uploads/products/1758706675360-xnsz54k5czm.jpg", ...],
        ...
      }
    ]
  }
  ```

### Admin Product Update - WORKING ‚úÖ
From the terminal logs, your admin product update **is working correctly**:

```
[API] Product updated { id: '925f8716-b7c5-4733-b377-f2a40cc56f1c' }
```

The Football product now has **3 new images**:
- `/uploads/products/1761603326792-qhu3hx0gjq.webp`
- `/uploads/products/1761603326808-ti3047ao9if.webp`
- `/uploads/products/1761603326811-hpb0dpgigf7.webp`

These images were **successfully saved to the database** and will persist with that product.

## üîç Frontend Issue - INVESTIGATING

### Symptoms:
- Homepage shows skeleton loaders (gray boxes)
- Products not rendering despite API working

### Added Debug Logging:
I've added console.log statements to `FeaturedProducts` component to track:
1. When API is called
2. API response
3. Products loaded count
4. Filtering logic
5. Final rendered products

## üìã Next Steps - CHECK BROWSER CONSOLE

### Open Browser Developer Tools:
1. **Open your browser** to http://localhost:9002
2. **Press F12** to open Developer Tools
3. **Click "Console" tab**
4. **Refresh the page**

### Look for these console messages:
```
[FeaturedProducts] API Response: { success: true, count: 6 }
[FeaturedProducts] Products loaded: 6
[FeaturedProducts] Filtering products: { category: 'All', totalProducts: 6 }
[FeaturedProducts] Showing all products (first 6)
```

### Possible Issues to Check:

#### If you see:
- **"Failed to fetch products"** ‚Üí Network error, check if API is running
- **"Invalid API response"** ‚Üí API returning wrong format
- **"Skipping filter: { mounted: true, productsCount: 0 }"** ‚Üí Products not being set in state
- **No console logs at all** ‚Üí Component not mounting

#### Network Tab Check:
1. Go to **Network tab** in Dev Tools
2. Refresh page
3. Look for request to `/api/products?available=true`
4. Click on it to see:
   - **Status:** Should be `200`
   - **Response:** Should show products JSON

## üéØ Image Persistence Guarantee

### How Product Images Work:

1. **Upload via Admin:**
   - Images saved to: `public/uploads/products/`
   - URLs saved to database as JSON array

2. **Database Storage:**
   ```sql
   UPDATE products 
   SET imageUrls = '["url1.jpg", "url2.jpg"]'
   WHERE id = 'product-id'
   ```

3. **Retrieval:**
   - API reads from database
   - Returns same URLs
   - Images stay with product **forever** (until manually changed)

### Your Football Product Update:
‚úÖ **Confirmed working** - The 3 new images you uploaded are now permanently associated with that product in the database.

## üîß Quick Test Commands

### Test API Directly (in PowerShell):
```powershell
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:9002/api/products?available=true" -UseBasicParsing
$data = $response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json
Write-Host "Success: $($data.success)"
Write-Host "Product count: $($data.products.Count)"
$data.products | Format-Table id, name, @{Label="ImageCount";Expression={$_.images.Count}}
```

### Check Specific Product (Football):
```powershell
$response = Invoke-WebRequest -Uri "http://localhost:9002/api/products/925f8716-b7c5-4733-b377-f2a40cc56f1c" -UseBasicParsing
$product = ($response.Content | ConvertFrom-Json).product
Write-Host "Product: $($product.name)"
Write-Host "Images: $($product.images -join ', ')"
```

## üìû What to Report Back

Please check the browser console and let me know:

1. **What console logs appear?** (copy/paste the `[FeaturedProducts]` messages)
2. **Any errors in console?** (red messages)
3. **Network tab status?** (Is `/api/products` showing 200 OK?)
4. **Still showing skeleton loaders?** (Yes/No)

Based on your findings, I can provide the exact fix needed!
